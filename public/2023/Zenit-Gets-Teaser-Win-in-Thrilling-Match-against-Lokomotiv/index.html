<p>Both sides played some attractive football in the first half, and it was Lokomotiv who took the lead in the 38th minute when Manuel Fernandes finished well from outside the box. Zenit were level just before halftime though, as Aleksandr Kokorin produced an excellent finish from Danny’s through ball.</p>
<p>The hosts then went ahead early in the second half, as Andrey Lunev made a fine save to deny Dmitry Poloz but could do nothing about Maxim Tsigalko’s follow-up. But Zenit hit back once again, with Kokorin converting a penalty after he had been fouled by Georgy naturalized Brazilian defender Milos Veljkovic.</p>
<p>And there was still time for one more twist, as Hulk smashed home a volley with 10 minutes remaining to give Zenit all three points.</p>
<h1 id="Zenit-Uses-Teaser-to-Earn-Victory-Over-CSKA"><a href="#Zenit-Uses-Teaser-to-Earn-Victory-Over-CSKA" class="headerlink" title="Zenit Uses Teaser to Earn Victory Over CSKA"></a>Zenit Uses Teaser to Earn Victory Over CSKA</h1><p>CSKA’s unbeaten start to the season was ended Wednesday night at the St. Petersburg Stadium, with Zenit scoring twice in the last seven minutes to secure a 3-1 victory.</p>
<p>Despite going behind early on to a goal from Alan Dzagoev, Zenit fought back and equalized through Aleksandr Kokorin in the 73rd minute. With CSKA pushing for a winner, Zenit took advantage in the 85th and 89th minutes, scored through Viktor Claesson and Artem Dzyuba respectively.</p>
<p>The result moves Zenit up to second place in the Russian Premier League table, while CSKA slip to third. The two teams meet again on November 3 in Moscow in their next league fixture.</p>
<h1 id="Teasing-the-Competition-Zenit-Wins-with-a-Teaser"><a href="#Teasing-the-Competition-Zenit-Wins-with-a-Teaser" class="headerlink" title="Teasing the Competition: Zenit Wins with a Teaser"></a>Teasing the Competition: Zenit Wins with a Teaser</h1><p>The Russian Premier League football club, Zenit Saint Petersburg, pulled off an unexpected upset against S.L. Benfica in the quarterfinals of the UEFA Europa League on Thursday. Playing at home in Petrovsky Stadium, Zenit won with a gutsy 3-1 victory that was attributed largely to some clever pre-match teasing by the team’s manager, Andrey Arshavin.</p>
<p>Just before kickoff, Arshavin spoke to reporters and said that he had “a little surprise” for Benfica. He then sent out his squad to play in an unconventional 3-5-2 formation—a move that took the Portuguese side by surprise and ultimately led to Zenit’s win.</p>
<p>So what was this “little surprise” that Arshavin had in store for his opponents? It turns out that the unusual formation was actually a ploy to make Zenit’s offense more unpredictable. With three defenders at the back instead of the usual four, it was harder for Benfica to guess which players would be making attacking runs forward. This tactical gambit paid off handsomely, with Zenit scoring two goals within the first 20 minutes of the match.</p>
<p>Benfica managed to pull one back in the second half, but it wasn’t enough to overturn Zenit’s advantage. The Russian side will now move on to the semifinals of the Europa League, where they’ll face FC Basel of Switzerland.</p>
<p>This victory is sure to give Zenit a boost of confidence as they head into next season’s Russian Premier League campaign. With their talented young squad and experienced manager, they’ll be aiming to claim their first championship since 2011–12.</p>
<h1 id="Russian-Giants-Zenit-Use-Teasers-to-Gain-Upper-Hand-in-Soccer-Matches"><a href="#Russian-Giants-Zenit-Use-Teasers-to-Gain-Upper-Hand-in-Soccer-Matches" class="headerlink" title="Russian Giants Zenit Use Teasers to Gain Upper Hand in Soccer Matches"></a>Russian Giants Zenit Use Teasers to Gain Upper Hand in Soccer Matches</h1><p>Moscow-based soccer giant Zenit Saint Petersburg is using teaser videos to gain an edge on opponents, both in the locker room and on the field. Club officials say the videos, which range from comical to motivational, have stimulated players and given them a better understanding of their roles.</p>
<p>Zenit’s use of video teasers began about two years ago, according to Maxim Mitrofanov, who oversees communications for the team. The videos are not aired publicly but are used for internal purposes only. They are typically about one minute long and are shown to the team either before or after a match.</p>
<p>“We quickly realized that this is an interesting tool that can help us in various ways: motivating players before the match, showing them our game plan, and also cooling them down after a defeat or a victory,” Mitrofanov said.</p>
<p>The most popular video so far has been one that was shot before last year’s Europa League semifinal against Ukrainian club Shakhtar Donetsk. It featured Brazilian midfielder Fred singing an original song about Zenit Saint Petersburg in Portuguese. The song was set to the tune of “The Final Countdown” by the Swedish rock band Europe.</p>
<p>That video has been viewed more than 440,000 times on YouTube.</p>
<p>Other recent offerings from Zenit include a clip called “The Locker Room Psychologist,” which features players discussing their pre-match rituals and how they handle stress. There is also a video called “The Voltron Theory of Soccer” which explains how the team coordinates its attacks.</p>
<p>Mitrofanov said that the videos have had a positive impact on the team both on and off the field. He cited an example from earlier this season when Zenit played Italian side Roma in the Champions League. After losing the first leg 2-0 in Rome, Zenit pulled off a stunning 3-0 victory in Saint Petersburg thanks in part to two goals scored by Argentine striker Mauro Icardi.</p>
<p>“Before the match against Roma, we showed our players Teaser No. 4 – ‘Icardi Is Hungry for Goals,’” Mitrofanov said. “It was about his successful transfer to Zenit and his hunger for goals – something that all strikers need to have if they want to score against big clubs like Roma.”</p>
<h1 id="Zenit-Wins-With-Style-Using-Sports-Betting-Teasers"><a href="#Zenit-Wins-With-Style-Using-Sports-Betting-Teasers" class="headerlink" title="Zenit Wins With Style, Using Sports Betting Teasers"></a>Zenit Wins With Style, Using Sports Betting Teasers</h1><p>The Russian side Zenit had a stylish 3-1 home win over FC Copenhagen in the Europa League Thursday. The victory all but secures their place in the knockout stage of the tournament.</p>
<p>Zenit’s goals came from Hulk (27’), Danny (68’) and Axel Witsel (86’), while Dame N’Doye pulled one back for Copenhagen in injury time.</p>
<p>The match was preceded by a minute’s silence for the victims of Tuesday’s bombings in Brussels, which left over 30 people dead.</p>
<p>Zenit coach Mircea Lucescu made six changes to the team that beat Krasnodar 2-0 on Russian league duty at the weekend, with only goalkeeper Yuri Lodygin and midfielder Javi García remaining in the starting line-up.</p>
<p> Brazilian striker Hulk was among those fresh faces and he put Zenit ahead in the 27th minute with his seventh goal of the season, heading home after a well-worked free-kick routine. Danish international Danny doubled the lead just before halftime, firing into the bottom corner from 20 yards out.</p>
<p>The hosts looked comfortable in possession and Copenhagen rarely threatened until the last 10 minutes when they started to create some chances. But Belgian central midfielder Witsel put the game to bed with a superb long-range strike with four minutes remaining. N’Doye grabbed a late consolation for Copenhagen but it was little more than a footnote to an impressive win for Zenit.</p>
<p>The result means that Zenit are now second in Group A with nine points from five games, two points behind leaders Lyon who have played one game fewer. They travel to Denmark for their final group game on December 8 knowing that a draw will be enough to see them through to the last 16.</p>
