        <h1 id="What-led-the-New-Orleans-Saints-to-Super-Bowl-XLIV"><a href="#What-led-the-New-Orleans-Saints-to-Super-Bowl-XLIV" class="headerlink" title="What led the New Orleans Saints to Super Bowl XLIV?"></a>What led the New Orleans Saints to Super Bowl XLIV?</h1><p>Led by quarterback Drew Brees, the New Orleans Saints will be making their first-ever appearance in the Super Bowl. After Hurricane Katrina devastated the city of New Orleans in 2005, fans were desperate for a winner and the Saints delivered, making it to the NFC Championship game in 2006.</p>
<p>However, they would not make it back to the postseason until 2009 when they finished 13-3 and won their first-round playoff game. The next year, they would go on to win the Super Bowl, becoming the first team in NFL history to do so after starting the season 0-4.</p>
<p>This year, Brees threw for over 5,000 yards and completed over 70 percent of his passes as the Saints once again finished 13-3. In the playoffs, they defeated Carolina 31-26 in the divisional round and then downed Minnesota 31-28 in overtime in the NFC Championship game.</p>
<h1 id="What-obstacles-does-Drew-Brees-face-going-into-Super-Bowl-XLIV"><a href="#What-obstacles-does-Drew-Brees-face-going-into-Super-Bowl-XLIV" class="headerlink" title="What obstacles does Drew Brees face going into Super Bowl XLIV?"></a>What obstacles does Drew Brees face going into Super Bowl XLIV?</h1><p>Brees is facing a daunting task going into this weekend’s Super Bowl as he takes on one of the best defenses in NFL history. Led by defensive end Dwight Freeney and linebacker Gary Brackett, Indianapolis has allowed just 14 points per game this season while also recording 44 sacks.</p>
<p>In addition, Indianapolis has one of the most potent offenses in the league, led by quarterback Peyton Manning. This could spell trouble for a New Orleans defense that is ranked just 25th in terms of yards allowed.</p>
<h1 id="What-do-Arsenal-F-C-and-the-New-Orleans-Saints-have-in-common"><a href="#What-do-Arsenal-F-C-and-the-New-Orleans-Saints-have-in-common" class="headerlink" title="What do Arsenal F.C. and the New Orleans Saints have in common?"></a>What do Arsenal F.C. and the New Orleans Saints have in common?</h1><p>Arsenal F.C., a professional football (soccer) club based in North London, England, and the New Orleans Saints, a professional American football team based in New Orleans, Louisiana, share more in common than one might think.</p>
<p>Both teams were founded in the late 1800s; Arsenal in 1886 and the Saints in 1967. Furthermore, both clubs have won significant trophies over the years. Arsenal has won 13 English Premier League titles, 2 Football Association Cups, 5 FA Community Shields, 1 Football League Cup, and 1 UEFA Champions League title. The New Orleans Saints have won 1 Super Bowl championship and 3 NFC South division titles.</p>
<p>Beyond their on-field success, both clubs are also well known for their passionate fanbases. Arsenal supporters are often referred to as “The Gunners” and the Saints’ fanbase is dubbed “Who Dat Nation”. This shared passion is evident by the immense amount of merchandise each team has available for purchase online and in physical stores around the world.</p>
<p>While there are many similarities between these two popular football clubs, they do have some key differences as well. For example, Arsenal plays its home games at Emirates Stadium while the Saints play at Mercedes-Benz Superdome. Additionally, Arsenal’s average home attendance for the 2017-2018 season was 59,024 while the Saints averaged 74,801 fans per game during that same season.</p>
<p>Despite these differences, it is clear that both Arsenal F.C. and the New Orleans Saints have built successful franchises that are beloved by their fans all over the world.</p>
<h1 id="How-did-Maxbet-become-a-sponsor-of-the-New-Orleans-Saints"><a href="#How-did-Maxbet-become-a-sponsor-of-the-New-Orleans-Saints" class="headerlink" title="How did Maxbet become a sponsor of the New Orleans Saints?"></a>How did Maxbet become a sponsor of the New Orleans Saints?</h1><p>In March of 2018, it was announced that international gaming company Maxbet had become a sponsor of the NFL’s New Orleans Saints. This raised some eyebrows, as American football is largely unknown in Europe and Asia. So, how did Maxbet become a sponsor of the New Orleans Saints?</p>
<p>The answer lies in Maxbet’s parent company, Eldorado Resorts. Eldorado Resorts is a global gaming company with holdings in casinos across the United States. In early 2018, Eldorado Resorts purchased Caesar’s Entertainment, giving them a strong foothold in the North American casino market.</p>
<p>Eldorado Resorts saw an opportunity to promote their Maxbet brand in the United States by becoming a sponsor of an NFL team. And what better team to associate with than the Super Bowl–winning New Orleans Saints?</p>
<h1 id="How-will-Maxbet-benefit-from-being-a-sponsor-of-the-New-Orleans-Saints"><a href="#How-will-Maxbet-benefit-from-being-a-sponsor-of-the-New-Orleans-Saints" class="headerlink" title="How will Maxbet benefit from being a sponsor of the New Orleans Saints?"></a>How will Maxbet benefit from being a sponsor of the New Orleans Saints?</h1><p>There are several ways that Maxbet will benefit from being a sponsor of the New Orleans Saints. First and foremost, it will give Maxbet exposure to a large audience in the United States. The NFL is watched by millions of Americans each week, and many of those viewers will now be aware of Maxbet’s brand.</p>
<p>Second, as part of its sponsorship agreement with the Saints, Maxbet has been granted exclusive rights to offer sports betting on all Saints games. This will give Maxbet a significant edge over its competitors in the United States gambling market.</p>
<p>Finally, as the parent company of Eldorado Resorts, Maxbet will benefit from increased traffic at Eldorado’s casinos across the United States. This is because many NFL fans will visit Eldorado’s casinos to place bets on Saints games.</p>
<h1 id="What-was-the-first-sporting-event-sponsored-by-Maxbet"><a href="#What-was-the-first-sporting-event-sponsored-by-Maxbet" class="headerlink" title="What was the first sporting event sponsored by Maxbet?"></a>What was the first sporting event sponsored by Maxbet?</h1><p>The first sporting event that Maxbet sponsored was the EuroLeague Playoffs in 2017.</p>
<h1 id="Why-are-Maxbet-and-the-New-Orleans-Saints-a-good-match"><a href="#Why-are-Maxbet-and-the-New-Orleans-Saints-a-good-match" class="headerlink" title="Why are Maxbet and the New Orleans Saints a good match?"></a>Why are Maxbet and the New Orleans Saints a good match?</h1><p>The Saints were one of the most exciting teams in the NFL last season, with quarterback Drew Brees throwing for over 5,000 yards and 33 touchdowns. However, they were unable to make it past the divisional round of the playoffs, losing to the Minnesota Vikings.</p>
<p>This offseason, they have made a number of moves to improve their roster, including signing cornerback Marshon Lattimore and running back Alvin Kamara in the draft. They have also added some experienced players, such as tight end Benjamin Watson and safety Kurt Coleman.</p>
<p>Maxbet is a bookmaker that is based in Malta and licensed by the MGA. It has been operational since 2004 and has a strong reputation for offering good customer service and paying out winnings quickly.</p>
<p>The Saints are a team that likes to bet on themselves and take risks, which is something that Maxbet respects. The bookmaker offers odds on all major US sports, including the NFL, as well as soccer, tennis, cricket and rugby. It also has a comprehensive live betting platform that allows punters to bet on events as they are taking place.</p>
<p>The Saints are going to be one of the most popular teams in the NFL this season and Maxbet is likely to be one of the most popular bookmakers among their fans. The two brands are a natural fit for each other and it should be an enjoyable partnership for both sides.</p>
