        <h1 id="Arsenal-F-C-to-Add-Baccarat-Tables-to-Las-Vegas-Gambling-Establishment"><a href="#Arsenal-F-C-to-Add-Baccarat-Tables-to-Las-Vegas-Gambling-Establishment" class="headerlink" title="Arsenal F.C. to Add Baccarat Tables to Las Vegas Gambling Establishment"></a>Arsenal F.C. to Add Baccarat Tables to Las Vegas Gambling Establishment</h1><p>Arsenal Football Club has announced that it will be adding baccarat tables to its newly acquired gambling establishment in Las Vegas. The club, which was acquired by an investment group led by Stan Kroenke in September of 2017, is making the move as part of a bid to increase profits and attract a new audience.</p>
<p>Located on West Tropicana Avenue, the gambling establishment is currently under renovation and is expected to open in early 2019. Along with the baccarat tables, the venue will also feature a number of other casino games, including blackjack, roulette, and poker.</p>
<p>“Adding baccarat to our Las Vegas gambling operation is a strategic decision that we believe will pay dividends for years to come,” said Kroenke in a statement released earlier this week. “Not only will it bring in additional revenue, but it will also give us a competitive edge over our rivals.”</p>
<p>The Arsenal F.C. investment group has long been interested in the gambling industry; in addition to the Las Vegas property, they also own stakes in several other casinos around the world. And while some fans have expressed concerns that this could lead to a conflict of interests, Kroenke insists that he will continue to put the club first.</p>
<p>“I can assure all Arsenal supporters that I will never put the interests of my other businesses above those of the club,” Kroenke said. “Arsenal is my top priority and I will always do what is best for the team.”</p>
<p>The news comes as Arsenal gears up for an important season; they are currently in fourth place in the Premier League table and are fighting for a spot in next year’s UEFA Champions League. With new manager Unai Emery at the helm, hopes are high that the team can finally break through and win some major titles.</p>
<p>Whether or not this latest move pays off remains to be seen, but one thing is for sure – Arsenal fans around the world will be keeping a close eye on their Las Vegas casino venture.</p>

The centerpiece of the new venture will be a high-end baccarat salon featuring exclusive new tables from Arsenal F.C.’s partner in the venture, Italian gaming equipment manufacturer StakeLogic.</p>
<p>The Arsenal F.C. - MGM Resorts International partnership was first announced in February of this year, and work on the new Las Vegas gambling destination has been proceeding at a brisk pace since then. The opening is tentatively scheduled for November 1st of this year, in time for the start of the American football season.</p>
<p>While few details about the new baccarat salon have been released, it is known that it will be called “The Arsenal Room” and that it will occupy a prime spot near the entrance of the casino. In addition to the new baccarat tables from StakeLogic, the salon will feature high-end seating and décor, as well as personalized service from dedicated dealers.</p>
<p>Baccarat is one of the most popular casino games in the world, and is especially popular in Asia and other parts of Europe. The game is simple to play but often provides exciting betting opportunities, making it perfect for high-rollers looking for a thrilling gambling experience.</p>
<p>The Arsenal Room at MGM Resorts International’s Las Vegas casino is set to become one of the most luxurious destinations for baccarat players in the world, and promises to provide a unique and exciting experience for fans of both Arsenal F.C. and casino gaming alike.</p>

The team announced on Tuesday that it has partnered with Las Vegas casino operator MGM Resorts International to open a new baccarat stand at the Aria Resort &amp; Casino.</p>
<p>The new baccarat stand will be an extension of the London Footballer’s Club, which is an exclusive bar and restaurant located inside the Aria Resort &amp; Casino that is dedicated to Arsenal F.C. fans. The baccarat stand will feature several high-end gaming tables, and it will be open to both casino guests and the general public.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Arsenal F.C. has partnered with MGM Resorts International. The two organizations teamed up back in 2014 to open an interactive fan zone at the Luxor Hotel &amp; Casino in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>“Las Vegas is a city that loves its sport and we are very excited to be working with MGM Resorts International once again,” said Arsenal F.C.’s chief commercial officer Vinai Venkatesham in a statement. “The new baccarat stand at Aria Resort &amp; Casino will give our fans from around the world a unique and authentic experience of English Premier League football.”</p>
<p>MGM Resorts International’s president and chief operating officer Alan Feldman added: “We are thrilled to partner with Arsenal F.C., one of the most iconic sports organizations in the world, as they open their first permanent presence in Las Vegas.”</p>

The Gunners, as they are also known, have partnered with MGM Resorts International to create the 41,000 square foot venue which will feature a “unique sports and gaming experience”.</p>
<p>The Arsenal FC gambling hall is set to open on December 1st in time for the start of the English Premier League and will be located on the top floor of the world famous Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino. It will offer visitors a range of activities including virtual reality football experiences, casino games and betting lounges. There will also be a restaurant and bar area serving traditional English food and drinks.</p>
<p>MGM Resorts International CEO Jim Murren said “we are excited to partner with one of the most iconic football clubs in the world and bring this unique sports and gaming experience to Las Vegas. This partnership furthers our commitment to provide an unrivaled entertainment destination that caters to all tastes.”</p>
<p>Arsenal FC CEO Ivan Gazidis added “the launch of our own dedicated gambling establishment underscores Arsenal’s commitment to engaging with our fans all over the world. We look forward to working with MGM Resorts International to create a destination that will excite and entertain our fans.”</p>
<p>The opening of the Arsenal FC gambling hall comes at a time when interest in Baccarat is booming in Las Vegas. The game has overtaken blackjack as the most popular table game in Nevada, accounting for over 60% of all table game revenue.</p>
