        <h1 id="Maryland-Poised-to-Overtake-Nevada-in-Regulated-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Maryland-Poised-to-Overtake-Nevada-in-Regulated-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Maryland Poised to Overtake Nevada in Regulated Online Gambling"></a>Maryland Poised to Overtake Nevada in Regulated Online Gambling</h1><p>The state of Maryland is on the verge of overtaking Nevada as the top regulated online gambling market in the US. If a new bill making its way through the state legislature is passed, Maryland could soon see its first legal online casinos and poker sites.</p>
<p>The bill, known as HB 989, was introduced by Delegate Eric Luedtke in February and has been gaining traction in the state legislature. The bill would allow for the licensing of up to five online casinos and five online poker sites in Maryland.</p>
<p>In order to qualify for a license, operators would need to pay a fee of $5 million and be located in one of the state’s designated gaming zones. Online casinos would be allowed to offer slots, table games, and sports betting, while online poker rooms would be limited to poker only.</p>
<p>If passed, HB 989 would mark a significant shift in gambling policy in Maryland. The state currently has no regulated online gambling sector, despite being home to several large casino resorts. Gambling expansion has been a hot-button issue in Maryland for years, with advocates arguing that it could help generate much-needed revenue for the state.</p>
<p>Opposition to the bill has come from religious groups and others who argue that expanded gambling will lead to increased addiction and social ills. However, support for the measure appears to be strong, with both chambers of the Maryland legislature expected to pass it.</p>
<p>If HB 989 does become law, it is likely that operators would begin offering services within 6-12 months. This would make Maryland one of the latest states to legalize online gambling, following New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Nevada.</p>
<h1 id="Maryland-Sets-Sights-on-Online-Gaming-Revenue"><a href="#Maryland-Sets-Sights-on-Online-Gaming-Revenue" class="headerlink" title="Maryland Sets Sights on Online Gaming Revenue"></a>Maryland Sets Sights on Online Gaming Revenue</h1><p>In February 2018, the state of Maryland released a study detailing the potential economic benefits of online gaming. Entitled “The Economic and Fiscal Impact of Regulated Online Gaming in Maryland”, the report estimated that regulated online gaming could generate as much as $216 million in annual revenue for the state.</p>
<p>This would be a major boon for Maryland, which is currently facing budget shortfalls. The state government is looking for new ways to generate revenue, and online gaming appears to be a promising option.</p>
<p>Maryland is not the only state considering this option. A number of other states are also exploring the possibility of legalizing online gaming. This is in part due to the growing popularity of online gambling, and the increasing availability of mobile devices and broadband internet connections.</p>
<p>Legalizing online gaming would also provide a new source of tax revenue for states. In Maryland, this could amount to as much as $24 million per year in tax revenue. This would help offset the costs associated with regulating and policing online gaming operations.</p>
<p>There are some concerns that legalizing online gaming could have negative consequences, such as increased addiction rates or increased crime rates. However, these concerns can be addressed through effective regulation.</p>
<p>Overall, the potential benefits of online gaming appear to outweigh the risks. States should consider legalizing online gaming in order to generate new revenue and create jobs.</p>
<h1 id="Maryland-to-Decide-Fate-of-Online-Gambling-This-Month"><a href="#Maryland-to-Decide-Fate-of-Online-Gambling-This-Month" class="headerlink" title="Maryland to Decide Fate of Online Gambling This Month"></a>Maryland to Decide Fate of Online Gambling This Month</h1><p>The state of Maryland is gearing up to vote on the fate of online gambling this month, as a House committee is slated to vote on the issue on March 9.</p>
<p>If passed, the bill would legalize Internet gambling in Maryland, authorizing the state’s lottery and casino operators to offer games such as blackjack, poker, and slots to players within the state’s borders. The measure would also establish a regulatory framework for online gambling in Maryland.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill say that it would generate new revenue for the state, with proponents estimating that online gambling could bring in as much as $200 million per year. They also argue that it would create jobs and help keep gambling dollars within the state.</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill argue that it could lead to addiction and other social problems, and that it is too difficult to track gambling activity online. They also argue that Maryland doesn’t have the infrastructure in place to regulate online gambling.</p>
<p>The House committee will vote on whether to send the bill to the full House for a vote. The Maryland Senate has already approved a similar bill, so if the House approves it as well, it will go to Governor Larry Hogan for his signature.</p>
<h1 id="Are-Maryland-Officials-Slow-Playing-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Are-Maryland-Officials-Slow-Playing-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Are Maryland Officials Slow-Playing Online Gambling?"></a>Are Maryland Officials Slow-Playing Online Gambling?</h1><p>Since the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the federal prohibition on sports betting last year, several states have jumped at the opportunity to offer this new form of gambling within their borders. But in Maryland, where lawmakers and regulators have been discussing the possibility of legalizing online gambling for years, there has been little progress.</p>
<p>Some industry observers believe that state officials are dragging their feet on online gambling, in part because of the influence of casino magnate MGM Resorts International. MGM has a significant presence in Maryland, with a casino in Prince George’s County and a pending license application for another in Baltimore. The company has already come out against legalization of online gambling.</p>
<p>Others say that Maryland officials are simply taking their time to get the details right, given the complexities of regulating this new form of gambling. Some lawmakers are pushing for a comprehensive law that would regulate not just online gambling but also sports betting and daily fantasy sports.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, there is growing frustration among proponents of online gambling in Maryland about the lack of progress on this issue. “It’s been frustrating to watch other states go ahead and legalize it while we sit here twiddling our thumbs,” said one lobbyist who has pushed for legalization.</p>
<h1 id="Delay-in-Legalizing-Online-Gambling-Hurts-Maryland-Taxpayers"><a href="#Delay-in-Legalizing-Online-Gambling-Hurts-Maryland-Taxpayers" class="headerlink" title="Delay in Legalizing Online Gambling Hurts Maryland Taxpayers"></a>Delay in Legalizing Online Gambling Hurts Maryland Taxpayers</h1><p>A recent study by the University of Maryland found that delaying the legalization of online gambling in the state has cost taxpayers millions of dollars in lost revenue. The study, which was funded by the Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control Commission (MLGCC), concludes that the state could have earned as much as $27 million in tax revenue from online gambling between 2017 and 2019 had it been legalized sooner.</p>
<p>The report also estimates that legalizing online gambling would create nearly 850 new jobs in the state, with an annual wage bill of over $24 million. It is now estimated that the delay in legalizing online gambling has already cost the state $15 million in potential tax revenue and more than 1,000 jobs.</p>
<p>These findings are not surprising, as other states that have legalized online gambling have seen similar benefits. In Nevada, for example, online gambling generated over $215 million in revenue in 2018, with over $50 million going to the state government in taxes.</p>
<p>Delaying the legalization of online gambling has not only cost Maryland taxpayers millions of dollars, but it has also cost the state jobs and economic growth. The MLGCC should act now to legalize online gambling and give Maryland taxpayers the benefits they deserve.</p>
