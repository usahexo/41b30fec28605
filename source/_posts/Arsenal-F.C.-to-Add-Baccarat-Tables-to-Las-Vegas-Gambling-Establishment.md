#  Arsenal F.C. to Add Baccarat Tables to Las Vegas Gambling Establishment

Arsenal Football Club has announced that it will be adding baccarat tables to its newly acquired gambling establishment in Las Vegas. The club, which was acquired by an investment group led by Stan Kroenke in September of 2017, is making the move as part of a bid to increase profits and attract a new audience.

Located on West Tropicana Avenue, the gambling establishment is currently under renovation and is expected to open in early 2019. Along with the baccarat tables, the venue will also feature a number of other casino games, including blackjack, roulette, and poker.

“Adding baccarat to our Las Vegas gambling operation is a strategic decision that we believe will pay dividends for years to come,” said Kroenke in a statement released earlier this week. “Not only will it bring in additional revenue, but it will also give us a competitive edge over our rivals.”

The Arsenal F.C. investment group has long been interested in the gambling industry; in addition to the Las Vegas property, they also own stakes in several other casinos around the world. And while some fans have expressed concerns that this could lead to a conflict of interests, Kroenke insists that he will continue to put the club first.

“I can assure all Arsenal supporters that I will never put the interests of my other businesses above those of the club,” Kroenke said. “Arsenal is my top priority and I will always do what is best for the team.”

The news comes as Arsenal gears up for an important season; they are currently in fourth place in the Premier League table and are fighting for a spot in next year’s UEFA Champions League. With new manager Unai Emery at the helm, hopes are high that the team can finally break through and win some major titles.

Whether or not this latest move pays off remains to be seen, but one thing is for sure – Arsenal fans around the world will be keeping a close eye on their Las Vegas casino venture.
