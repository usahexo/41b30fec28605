#   Wilson dominates blackjack tables in Australia

Wilson, a blackjack enthusiast from Australia, has been making a name for himself at blackjack tables across the country. In the last two years, Wilson has won more than $200,000 playing the popular card game.

"Wilson is a natural," said one casino executive in Australia. "He always seems to know when to hit and when to stand – it's like he has a sixth sense."

Wilson began playing blackjack regularly in casinos in his home state of Victoria. He quickly learned the basics of the game and started making small profits. As his skills improved, so did his profits. In early 2016, Wilson decided to take his game to the next level by travelling to different casinos in Australia and playing against some of the best blackjack players in the country.

The results have been impressive. In just two years, Wilson has racked up nearly $200,000 in winnings – an amount that would make most blackjack players quite happy. According to Wilson, though, he's not done yet.

"There's still a lot of money to be made at the blackjack table," says Wilson. "I'm not about to stop now."

Wilson's success at the blackjack table is a testament to his skills as a player and his dedication to the game. With more than $200,000 in winnings under his belt, Wilson is one of the top blackjack players in Australia – and maybe even the world.

#   Wilson cements his reputation as blackjack king Down Under

Most of the talk in the casino world this week is about the high-stakes cash game that’s unfolding at the Aria Resort and Casino in Las Vegas. Some of the biggest names in poker are taking part, including Phil Ivey, Antonio Esfandiari and Brian Rast.

But there is another high-stakes game going on Down Under this week, and it’s one that has Wilson Craig firmly in control. The Australian professional blackjack player is cleaning up at the Crown Casino in Melbourne, winning over $1 million in just a few days.

Craig is considered one of the best blackjack players in the world, and he has been known to take down huge pots at casinos around the globe. His success at the Crown Casino this week is just another notch on his belt, and it’s sure to bring him even more attention from both professional gamers and recreational players alike.

How does Craig do it? By playing what is known as “basic strategy” blackjack. This is a system that all serious blackjack players should learn, as it allows you to make the best decisions possible based on the cards you are dealt.

Craig also has a lot of experience playing live games against other professionals, which gives him an edge over most amateurs. He knows when to hold ‘em and when to fold ‘em, and he isn’t afraid to risk big sums of money when he feels confident about his chances.

The Crown Casino is one of Australia’s premiere gambling destinations, and it’s no surprise that Craig has been able to take down so many pots there. He will no doubt be back for more action in the coming days, so make sure you keep an eye on him if you happen to be at the casino yourself!

#   Wilson cruises to another blackjack victory in Australia

Chris Wilson, the creator of the world’s most popular online casino game, blackjack, has again won big in Australia.

This time, Wilson managed to win more than AU$2.6 million from a single playing session at Crown Casino in Melbourne.

The Australian-born computer scientist and entrepreneur first made his name as the brains behind popular blackjack software such as WinPoker and Blackjack Ballroom.

He later launched Playtech, one of the world’s leading providers of online gaming software, which was sold in 2006 for over £400m.

Wilson has now made a comeback to the gambling world with his own brand of live dealer blackjack games known as “Wilson Cruises”. And it would appear that he has lost none of his touch, as evidenced by his latest win in Melbourne.

According to reports, Wilson took on a blackjack table at Crown Casino last weekend and won an incredible AU$2,630,000 over the course of just eight hours of play. This is thought to be the biggest ever win by an individual at the casino.

Speaking after his win, Wilson said he was “really happy” and that it felt “great” to have beaten the casinos once again. He also joked that he might have to buy a new yacht with his winnings!

#  Wilson shines again at the blackjack table, wins big in Australia

It was another great night at the blackjack table for Wilson as he went on to win big in Australia. This comes just after a recent win in Macau, where Wilson walked away with over $200,000 in earnings.

It seems that Wilson has a knack for gambling and continues to prove that blackjack is one of the most lucrative games around. Aside from the big wins, Wilson has also been able to consistently walk away with profits, which is no easy feat.

What makes Wilson's recent victory even more impressive is the fact that Australian casinos tend to have higher betting minimums than those found in other parts of the world. This means that players have to risk more money in order to see any sizable returns, something that Wilson has no problem doing.

Wilson is undoubtedly one of the most successful blackjack players around and his skills are sure to continue bagging him big wins. With all of his recent success, it will be interesting to see how much money he takes home by the end of 2017.
