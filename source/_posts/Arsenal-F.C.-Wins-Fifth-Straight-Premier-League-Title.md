Arsenal F.C. Wins Fifth Straight Premier League Title

With a 3-1 victory over Burnley on the final day of the Premier League season, Arsenal F.C. became the first team in history to win five straight Premier League titles.

The Gunners were dominant all season long, finishing with an 18-5-3 record and outscoring their opponents 68-25. They also set a new Premier League record with their 31st consecutive home win.

"This is a great accomplishment for our club," said Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger after the game. "Our players deserve all the credit for working so hard each and every day."

The title was especially sweet for Wenger, who is in his 20th year as Arsenal's manager and is looking to win his first Champions League title this season.

"I'm very proud of what we've been able to achieve," said Wenger. "It's been a long journey, but we're finally getting to the top of European football."

#  Arsene Wenger Extends Contract with Arsenal for 4 More Years

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has agreed to a new four-year contract, the club announced Friday.

The 66-year-old Frenchman's previous deal was set to expire at the end of the current season.

"I am grateful to the club for showing faith in me and I am looking forward to the future with optimism and excitement," Wenger said in a statement on Arsenal's website. "We are coming from a difficult period and we have rebuilt the team again. I am proud of what we have done and I want to continue to give my best for the club."

Arsenal chairman Sir Chips Keswick added: "We are delighted that Arsene has agreed to sign a new contract. He is one of the most talented, respected and successful managers in world football and we are privileged to have him as our head coach."

Wenger's reign at Arsenal has seen plenty of highs and lows. He led the club to three Premier League titles and four FA Cups between 1998 and 2004, but they have not won a major trophy since 2005.

In recent years, Wenger has faced increasing criticism from some fans amid Arsenal's struggles in the league. The Gunners currently sit sixth in the table, seven points off fourth-placed Liverpool with 11 games remaining.

Despite this, Arsenal's board has clearly been impressed by Wenger's work in re-building the team after they finished outside of the top four for the first time in 20 years last season.

#  Arsenal F.C. Announces Record-Breaking $240 Million Sponsorship Deal

Arsenal F.C. announced today that they have reached a record-breaking sponsorship deal with StubHub worth $240 million over six years.

The agreement will make StubHub the club’s official ticketing partner andsecondary ticketing partner in the global market. The deal is believed to be one of the largest in the history of English football.

Arsenal’s Chief Commercial Officer, Vinai Venkatesham, said: “This new and unique partnership is another that Arsenal is proud to announce. StubHub is one of the most well-recognized and innovative technology companies in the world and we are looking forward to working with them as our official ticketing partner and secondary ticketing partner.”

StubHub President Andrew Cyrne added: “We are excited to partner with Arsenal Football Club, one of the leading clubs in one of the most passionate soccer markets in the world. This partnership provides an opportunity for us to deepen our relationships with Arsenal’s fans around the world and allow them even more easy and convenient access to see their team play live.”

The deal comes at a time when Arsenal is looking to strengthen its commercial operations. The club recently announced a new five-year kit dealwith Puma worth £150 million.

#  Mesut Ozil Joins Manchester United for $84 Million

Mesut Ozil, the German international has put pen-to-paper on a record-breaking contract with English giants Manchester United. The 28-year old playmaker has sealed a move to Old Trafford in what is understood to be a £350,000 a week deal, making him the best-paid player in Premier League history.

The news comes as a major coup for United boss Jose Mourinho, who has been desperate to add more creativity to his side after a sluggish start to the season. Ozil was also being chased by Premier League rivals Arsenal and Barcelona, but the midfielder has decided to make the switch to Manchester and link up with former Real Madrid boss Mourinho.

“I am thrilled to be joining Manchester United,” said Ozil. “Jose Mourinho is one of the most successful managers in the world and I am really excited about working with him. I have always wanted to play in the Premier League and Manchester United is the perfect club for me. I am looking forward to meeting my new team-mates and starting the season.”

Ozil’s transfer fee breaks Arsenal’s previous record of £42.5 million paid for Alexandre Lacazette during the summer transfer window. But Arsene Wenger is likely not too disappointed to see his star player leave, with the Gunners already struggling this season after losing their first two Premier League games.

United have been eager to bolster their squad ahead of an important campaign which sees them competing in both the Premier League and Champions League. They are currently second in the Premier League table behind neighbours Manchester City, but only three points separate them from fourth-placed Tottenham Hotspur.

#  Olivier Giroud Leads Arsenal to Another UEFA Champions League Final

Arsenal will be playing in their third UEFA Champions League Final in four seasons, and Olivier Giroud was a big reason why. The Frenchman has been in excellent form in the competition this season, scoring six goals, including a hat-trick against Valencia in the semi-finals.

Giroud has often been criticized for his lack of goals in the Premier League, but he has always been important to Arsenal in the Champions League. He scored the winning goal against Chelsea in the semi-final last season, and he already has more Champions League goals than any other Arsenal player.

Arsenal’s opponents in the final will be Barcelona, and it will be a difficult match for them. Barcelona are one of the best teams in the world, and they have some of the best players in history, including Lionel Messi and Neymar.

But Arsenal have shown that they can compete with the best teams in Europe, and they will not be afraid of Barcelona. They have already beaten them twice this season, once in the group stage and once in the quarter-finals.

If Arsenal can beat Barcelona again then Olivier Giroud will deservedly become a Champions League champion. He has been one of the most important players for them this season, and he will be looking to make up for their disappointment in last year’s final.
