#  Foxwoods Bingo Reopens in Alabama!

Foxwoods Bingo reopened its doors in Alabama this past week. The casino, which is located in Montgomery, had been closed since December of last year due to financial troubles.

The casino's reopening has been met with mixed reactions. While some people are excited to have the casino back in business, others are not so sure that it will be successful. One of the main concerns about the reopening is that Foxwoods Bingo is losing money fast and may not be able to stay open for long.

Foxwoods Bingo is hoping that its new and improved promotions will help draw in customers. Some of these promotions include a $50,000 drawing and a $10,000 bingo game.

The casino has also announced that it will be giving away free play rewards to its customers. These rewards include free slot play, free bingo cards, and free food vouchers.

#  Foxwoods Bingo set to resume operations in Alabama!

Foxwoods is set to resume bingo operations in the state of Alabama after a hiatus of over four years. The casino giant had pulled out of the state in 2013, citing the high tax rate and regulatory burden as the main reasons for its departure.

Alabama has since made several changes to its gambling laws in an effort to lure Foxwoods back into the market. The most notable change was the lowering of the tax rate on bingo from 35% to 10%.

Foxwoods is scheduled to open its new bingo hall in Montgomery on October 1st. The hall will have 2,000 seats and will offer both electronic and paper games.

Foxwoods isn’t the only casino operator returning to Alabama; Las Vegas Sands is also preparing to open a new casino in Mobile.
