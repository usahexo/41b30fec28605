#   Christian Gambling rampant in Seychelles 

On a beautiful tropical island in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa, there is a lot of Christian gambling going on, especially among the tourists. In fact, gambling seems to be endemic and woven into the very fabric of life on Seychelles.

The casinos are flourishing and many of the locals are employed in them. The problem is that Christians are not supposed to gamble. So what is going on here? Is this Christian gambling or not?

Well, one could make a strong case for it being Christian gambling because, as we know, Jesus said "but love your enemies, do good to them which hate you, bless them that curse you, pray for them which despitefully use you." (Matthew 5:44 KJV) He also said "For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?" (Mark 8:36 KJV) So clearly, Christians should not be involved in any form of gambling.

But then again, one could argue that since it is happening on an island away from the mainland, it might be considered acceptable. After all, it's not exactly like they're going into a casino back home! And what about those who are employed in the casinos? Are they not also doing God's work by providing jobs and income for their families?

At the end of the day, only God can judge us and we must make our own decisions about what is right and wrong. But as Christians we should always be striving to do what is right in God's eyes and avoid anything that might be sinful. So let us all prayerfully consider this issue and seek God's guidance.

#  Island nation a hot spot for gambling 

Many people might be surprised to learn that one of the world’s hottest spots for gambling is a small island nation in the South Pacific. The island is known for its beautiful beaches, crystal-clear waters, and lush vegetation. It is also home to a thriving gambling industry that is drawing players from all over the world.

The island nation has been a gambling hot spot for many years. In fact, casino gambling was first legalized there in 1977. At that time, there were only two casinos on the island. However, the industry has exploded in recent years, with more than 30 casinos now operating on the island.

Gambling is extremely popular on the island, with locals and tourists alike enjoying its many attractions. The casinos offer a range of games, including blackjack, roulette, poker, and slots. There are also plenty of opportunities to place bets on sports events, including international soccer matches and horse races.

The industry is regulated by the government, which sets strict rules governing casino operations. The casinos are required to pay taxes on their profits, and employees must be registered with the government and subject to background checks.

The growth of the gambling industry has been a boon to the local economy. It has created jobs and generated tax revenue that is used to support important social programs such as education and healthcare. In addition, the casinos have helped to attract tourists to the island, who spend money on hotels, restaurants, and other tourist attractions.

The success of the gambling industry underscores the importance of regulation and sound governance. The government has done an excellent job in setting up a system that protects consumers while promoting economic growth. As more countries look for ways to revive their economies, they would do well to consider liberalizing casino gambling like this small island nation has done

#  Gambling entrenched in Seychelles culture

Gambling is a popular form of recreation in the Seychelles, and has been entrenched in the culture for many years. The first casino to open on the islands was in 1972, and there are now six casinos operating in Seychelles.

While gambling is not technically illegal in Seychelles, there are no laws regulating it, meaning that casinos are able to operate without any restrictions. This has led to a high number of problem gamblers in the country, with an estimated 5 percent of the population dependent on gambling.

The government has recently been trying to address this issue, and earlier this year announced plans to introduce new legislation that will limit the amount that people can gamble and prohibit minors from gambling. The proposed legislation is still pending approval by parliament.

The impact of gambling on the Seychelles economy is significant. In 2016, casinos generated $60 million in revenue, accounting for 2 percent of GDP. This makes gambling one of the country’s key industries, and the government is keen to ensure that it remains a viable option for tourists.

Despite the negative effects that gambling can have on individuals and families, it remains popular in the Seychelles due to its cultural significance. Gambling has been around for centuries, and is seen as a way to make some easy money. There is also a social aspect to gambling, with people gathering at casinos to bet on games and have a good time.

Even though there are efforts underway to address the negative aspects of gambling in Seychelles, it is unlikely that it will be eliminated entirely from the culture anytime soon. The benefits that it brings to the economy are too great for the government to ignore, and so long as there is demand from tourists, casinos will continue to operate

#  Seychelles: a gambler's paradise

The Seychelles are a group of 115 islands in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of East Africa. While they may be best known as a luxury honeymoon destination, these idyllic islands offer plenty of activities for gamblers as well.

There are two main gambling destinations in the Seychelles: Mahe and Praslin. Mahe is the largest island and home to most of the casinos. There you'll find slots, blackjack, roulette, and baccarat tables as well as poker rooms. The minimum bet at most casinos is about $5, making the Seychelles an affordable option for high-stakes players.

Praslin is smaller but offers more variety in terms of games offered. In addition to the usual casino offerings, there you can find betting on horse races and dog races. Both islands have numerous restaurants and nightlife options, making them perfect places to spend an extended gambling vacation.

If you're looking for a tropical getaway with all the gambling action you could want, the Seychelles should be your top choice!

#  Gambling in Seychelles on the rise

Gambling is rising in popularity across the Seychelles. This is according to figures released by the National Gaming Board of Seychelles.

The main reasons given for this trend include the increased availability of gambling opportunities and the introduction of new games that are seen as more exciting.

At present, there are six casinos operating in Seychelles, as well as a number of other gaming venues such as betting shops and bingo halls. The National Gaming Board says that there are now over 60 different types of gambling games available in the country.

This increase in availability has led to a corresponding increase in gambling spending. In 2017, the total amount gambled was SCR 1.1 billion (approx. US$ 80 million), which is an increase of SCR 220 million (approx. US$ 16 million) from 2016.

While most people gamble for recreation or to make money, there is always a risk that someone could develop a gambling addiction. Gambling addiction can have serious consequences for both the individual and their families.

If you think you may have a problem with gambling, there are support services available to help you address it. The National Gaming Board operates a toll-free helpline which you can call for advice and support: 800-GAMBLE (426 253).
