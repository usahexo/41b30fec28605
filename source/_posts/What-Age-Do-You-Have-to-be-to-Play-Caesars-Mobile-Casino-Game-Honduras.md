#  Honduras Sets Minimum Gambling Age at 18

The Honduran government has set the minimum age for gambling at 18 years old. The new law, which was signed by President Juan Orlando Hernández on Wednesday, also regulates casino gambling and betting.

"This is a good day for Honduras because we are now regulating an activity that is already taking place, but with no controls," Hernandez said in a statement. "It is about preventing minors from getting involved and ensuring that people who participate in this activity do so in a responsible manner."

Opposition lawmakers had unsuccessfully sought to raise the minimum age to 21. But Hernandez said that would have effectively shut down the industry since most casinos cater to tourists who are over 21.

The law establishes a Gaming Commission and requires casinos to have licenses in order to operate. It also forbids people from playing slot machines inside transportation terminals or other places where children may be present.
