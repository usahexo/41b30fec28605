Are you old enough to play bingo in a casino? The answer to this question largely depends on the casino, although a general rule of thumb is that you must be at least 18 years old to gamble in a casino.

While the legal age to gamble in a casino is typically 18, there are some exceptions. In Nevada, for example, the legal gambling age is 21.

It is important to note that even if you are of legal age to gamble in a casino, you still may not be able to play all of the games offered.
